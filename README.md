# CS229-from-scratch
CS229 From Scratch â€“ A project to re-implement core machine learning algorithms from the CS229 course entirely from scratch. The goal is to deeply understand the math and logic behind each model, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, PCA, and simple Neural Networks, using only Python and NumPy.
