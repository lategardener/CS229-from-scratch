CS229 From Scratch

Objective
Re-implement the core algorithms and concepts from the CS229 (Stanford, Andrew Ng & Tengyu Ma) course entirely from scratch, without using high-level libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. This project aims to gain a deep understanding of the mathematics and logic behind each algorithm while producing clean, reusable code.

Project Description

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental machine learning models, including:

Linear Regression: Closed-form solution and gradient descent

Logistic Regression: Gradient descent with L2 regularization

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Hinge loss and simplified kernels

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Eigen decomposition / SVD

Simple Neural Networks: One hidden layer with backpropagation

Each module includes:

Unit tests on small synthetic datasets

Jupyter notebooks for visualization and experimentation

Benchmark comparisons with scikit-learn to validate correctness

Skills Developed

Applied mathematics in machine learning

Advanced Python programming with NumPy

Project structuring and documentation

Implementing ML algorithms from scratch
